 <h1>Hey, I’m Iuliia Goriunova — UX/UI designer with a practical mindset.</h1>
<p>I design straightforward, user-friendly interfaces, and I enjoy building things that make sense — for real people, not just portfolios.</p>
ss B2C and B2B, product and marketing, in-house and as a contractor. And I still love the challenge of making complex things feel simple.</p>

<p>I started out in graphic design back in 2015, then moved into web design at Decathlon where I got into e-commerce and product thinking. Since then, I’ve worked on UI and UX across different teams — at ABBYY, as a contractor, and most recently at Blueface (Comcast Business).</p>

<p>Along the way, I picked up front-end skills like HTML, CSS, and a bit of Python, which helps me collaborate better with developers and bring ideas to life faster.</p>

<p>I like clean design, clear structure, and solving small problems that make a big difference.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UX/UI Design:</strong> from wireframes to polished interfaces</li>
  <li><strong>Front-End Friendly:</strong> I speak HTML/CSS, and I’m not scared of dev tools</li>
  <li><strong>Team Player:</strong> I work closely with devs, PMs, and other designers</li>
</ul>
