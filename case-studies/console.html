    <h3 class="text-2xl  mt-4 pb-4">Project</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-10">Our console is a key part of our communication platform, helping to monitor and manage calls for the whole company or specific teams. Even though the product is up and running, it has some minor issues. Since we're moving the portal to a new tech stack, it's a great time to review and update the interface. Our goal is to make the console work better and be more user-friendly.</p>
   </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl  mt-4 pb-4">Goal</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-10">Research and design solutions to fix known and newly discovered issues, improving the overall usability of the console.</p>
  </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl   mt-4 pb-4">My role</h3>
        <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-2">I created mockups, facilitated user interviews, and participated in workshops to gather insights and feedback. My work focused on understanding user needs and pain points to develop a more intuitive and effective console design.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl   mt-4 pb-4">Previous Research and Identified Issues</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">We had conducted some research earlier, which led to a few changes that needed testing.
    <span class="">Problems Identified from Previous Research:</span></p>
    <ul class="mb-10">
      <li class="mb-4 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Layout.</span> Users couldn't see their own calls and others' calls at the same time. We tested new layout ideas to allow simultaneous viewing of both.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Users.</span> At first, no users were shown, but there was a button to add all users to favorites without an option to remove them later.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Accessibility.</span> Adding or removing users from favorites was only possible through drag-and-drop, which wasn't accessible to all users.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl   mt-4 pb-4">Research Plan</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Also we wanted to ask some additional questions to understand how users using current implementation and what issues do they have.</p>
    <ol >
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Search and Filters.</span> - How and when users using filters and search?</br>- How easy for users to use filters and search?</br>- If there are any issues for users related to search and filters?</li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Favourites.</span>- If users understand where is the favourites?</br>
- How easy for users add/remove favourites?</br>
- How easy for users find their favourites? </li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Layout.</span> - What users thinks about current layout?</br>
- How easy for users to find information with this layout?</li>
  <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl"><span class="font-semibold">Calling.</span> - If users use console for making, receiving, transferring calls?</br>
- Do they know how perform this actions?</br>
- What issues do they have?</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="mt-6 mb-4">Method</h4>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-10">We conducted mederated remote testing using Figma and Google Meet.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-6 mb-4">Participants</h4>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-10">We sought users who were already using the tool and some new users. Our ideal participants worked in teams of more than three people, frequently making and receiving calls managed by any team member, such as in customer or technical support.</p>
    
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl   mt-4 pb-4">First Iteration</h3>
    <p class="text-xl font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">For the first two iteration we tested layout, favourites and search and filter behaviour.
    </br>
During the first iteration it become clear that current layout not ideal and we need to think about something new.</p>
<h4 class="mt-6 mb-4">Some Insights</h4>
    <ul >
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl">Users don't understand what filter is - title disappear after selecting</li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl">Users are not using the filters by group because groups not updated regularly by managers</li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl">Some users don't understand where is favourites in current layout but they like this feature in new design</li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl">Right panel with selected user calls confusing - participants expected to see details near the user card or on the left as in current version
</li>
      <li class="mb-2 font-light text-xl">Console too slow on loading</li>
    </ul>
